<p>
    We need to be prepared for emergency situations, so it would be good for us to develop a model evacuation process.
    Each of the rooms in the building are connected by corridors of various lengths. Each room may contain a varying
    number of occupants at any given time. We should calculate how many people can get to the evacuation zone by a given
    time.
</p>

<p>
    Room and hallway information can be represented in a matrix (M). Each room has a number from 0 to N where the matrix
    has size of NxN. In the diagonals we are given information about how many people occupy the room -- M[i][i] is how
    many people in the i-th room.<br>
    In other cells of the matrix, you are given an information about the hallways, specifically how much time (in
    minutes) is required to move from room i to room j (M[i][j] == M[j][i]). If time the is zero, then a hallway does
    not exist between these rooms. The evacuation zone is a room marked with the number 0 (zero).

</p>

<p>
    You are given a building matrix and evacuation time in minutes. People must always use the shortest path to evacuate
    the building. By the specified time, how many people will have escaped? For this mission, passing through a room
    doesnâ€™t take any time, only passing through hallways. A room will be considered evacuated if the total time to
    evacuate is less than or equal to the given time.

<p>
    For an example take a look at this image:
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
    <img title="example" src="{{MEDIA}}example.svg" alt="example"/>
</p>
<pre>[[ 0, 40,  0, 40,  0,   0],
 [40,  6,  0,  0, 40,   0],
 [ 0,  0,  3,  0, 28,   0]
 [40,  0,  0,  4, 40,  28]
 [ 0, 40, 28, 40,  1,   0]
 [ 0,  0,  0, 28,  0,   2]]
</pre>
<br>
<p>
    If the given time is 80, then rooms 1, 3, 4 and 5 will be completely evacuated and the result is 6+4+1+2=13.

</p>
<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Two arguments. Information about a building as a list of lists of integers and
    evacuation time as an integer.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The number of people who escaped in time as an integer.
