<p>
    We should be prepared for an emergency situations and model evacuation process.
    Rooms in the building are connected by corridors various length.
    And each room has various quantity of staffs in it.
    We should calculate how many people will be in evacuation room for the given time.
</p>

<p>
    A building room and passage information can be represented as a matrix (M).
    Each room has a number from 0 to N. The matrix has size NxN.
    In diagonals we are given information about how many people in the room --
    M[i][i] is how many people in the i-th room.<br>
    In other cell of matrix are given an information about passages --
    how much time (in minutes) are required to pass from room i to room j (M[i][j] == M[j][i]).
    If time is zero, then passage is not exist between these rooms.
    The evacuation room is a room with number 0 (zero).
</p>

<p>
    You are given a building matrix and evacuation time (minutes).
    People use the shortest path for evacuation. How many people will be escaped?
    The room pass don't take time, only passages.
    The room will be escaped if total time to evacuation room is <strong>less or equal</strong>
    than the given time.

<p>
    For example look at the image
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
    <img title="example" src="{{MEDIA}}example.svg" alt="example"/>
</p>
<pre>
[[ 0, 40,  0, 40,  0,   0],
 [40,  6,  0,  0, 40,   0],
 [ 0,  0,  3,  0, 28,   0]
 [40,  0,  0,  4, 40,  28]
 [ 0, 40, 28, 40,  1,   0]
 [ 0,  0,  0, 28,  0,   2]]
</pre>

<p>
    It the maximum time is 80, then rooms 1, 3, 4 and 5 will be escaped and the result is
    6+4+1+2=13.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Two arguments. Information about a building as a list of lists of integers and
    evacuation time as an integer.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> How many people will escape as an integer.

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This model can be used for various cases. For example for flood or gathering resources and etc.
